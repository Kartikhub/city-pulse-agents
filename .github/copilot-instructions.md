This workspace contains a simple Python agent system for City Pulse. There are three agents: ConciergeAgent, EventAgent, and EnvironmentAgent. No database is used; all data is dummy data. The ConciergeAgent orchestrates requests to the EventAgent and EnvironmentAgent and returns combined results. Each agent is implemented as a separate Python module. The main script demonstrates their interaction.
